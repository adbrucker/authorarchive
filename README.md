## Installation

The package is [available on CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/authorarchive) and is
packaged in both MiKTeX and TeX Live. Thus, no manual installation should be
requried. In case you still want to install the package manually, copy
`authorarchive.sty` in a directory that is searched by LaTeX (e.g., either
your `texmf` tree or the local directory with your main LaTeX file).

## Usage

A simple use for LNCS-formatted papers is as follows:

```tex
\usepackage{authorarchive}
\authorsetup{LNCS,
   key=brucker-authorarchive-2016,
   year=2016,
   publication={Anonymous et al.\ (eds).
       Proceedings of the International Conference on LaTeX-Hacks,
       LNCS~42.
       Some Publisher}
   startpage={42},
   doi={00/00_00},
   doiText={0/00\_00},
   nocopyright
}
```

Note that this is the preferred way of configuring the package, as it allows,
e.g., for LaTeX commands in options. Only if no (complex) LaTeX commands are
used, the configuration can also be passes as package options (this is a
limitation of the way LaTeX is passing options to packages):

```tex
\usepackage[LNCS,
   key=brucker-authorarchive-2016,
   year=2016,
   publication={Anonymous et al.\ (eds).
       Proceedings of the International Conference on LaTeX-Hacks,
       LNCS~42.
       Some Publisher}
   startpage={42},
   doi={00/00_00},
   doiText={0/00\_00},
   nocopyright
]{authorarchive}
```

The following layout-styles are pre-defined:

- `ACM` for the two-column layout used by many ACM conferences
- `ENTCS` for the Elsevier ENTCS layout
- `IEEE` for the two-column layout used by many IEEE conferences
- `LNCS` for the LNCS layout (as used by Springer)
- `LNI` for the Lecture Notes in Informatics, published by the GI

By re-defining the font command (`authorcrfont{}`) and the command that is
used for positioning the copyright text (`\authorat{}`), the package can
be adapted easily to other layouts. For example,

```tex
\renewcommand{\authorcrfont}{\scriptsize}
\renewcommand{\authorat}[1]{\put(25,56.5){#1}}
```

works nicely for Acta Informatica.

### Boolean Switches

| Switch        | Meaning                                                                                                           |
| --            | --                                                                                                                |
| `nocopyright` | If present, no publisher's copyright notice is printed. Usual case for LNCS.                                      |
| `nourl`       | If present, no link to the publication is inserted.                                                               |
| `nobib`       | If present, no embedding of bibliographic entries is made.                                                        |
| `orcidicon`   | For layouts displaying the author's ORCID identifiers as text, replace the ORCID identifier by the ORICD iD icon and a hyperlink (currently only supported for LNCS). |

### Key/Value Options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `bibtexdir`| `.` | The directory where the bibliography entries are listed. |
| `baseurl` | <https://git.logicalhacking.com/adbrucker/authorarchive/src/main> | The URL used as prefix for building the links. |
| `suffix` | `.pdf` | The suffix to use at links. |
| `publisher` | `UNKOWN PUBLISHER` | The name of the publisher. Default values are set by the series (`LNCS`, ...). |
| `year` | `UNKOWN YEAR` | The year of the publication. |
| `key` | empty | The basename of the filename. Used also to generate links. |
| `doi` | empty | The DOI of the publication. Used to generate the DOI link. |
| `doiText` | The value of `doi` | In case a DOI contains underscores, the displayed text differs from the DOI. |
| `publisherurl` | empty | In case no DOI is provided, one can provide a link to the publisher. |
| `startpage` | 1 | The pagenumber of the first page of the paper. |
| `publication` | `UNKNOWN PUBLICATION` | Information on the publication. |

The package also defines a command `\authorsetup{}` which allows to
define key value options dynamically. Moreover, if a file
`authorarchive.config` exists in the LaTeX search path, it will be
loaded automatically. This allows for configuring defaults (e.g., the
baseurl) easily.

## Embedding Bibliographic Entries

Mostly, it is hard for scientists to find the correct BibTeX entry for
a paper.  One solution to this issue is to embed the respective `.bib`
(BibTeX, for LaTeX users), `.enw` (Endnote), `.ris`, or `.word.xml`
(Word 2007 or later) file in the PDF directly. In case any of these
file exist in `bibtexdir`, it gets embedded in the PDF.

You can use the
[bibutils](https://sourceforge.net/p/bibutils/home/Bibutils/) for
converting between these different formats for bibliographic
references easily.

## Notes on Self-Archiving

Before using this package, please check with your signed copyright form,
which rights you have. Especially whether you may self-archive the preprint
or the postprint. For more information on that, read on at
<https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/understanding-your-rights-pre-prints-post-prints-and-publisher-versions/>.

None of the authors might be hold liable for copyright
violations by using this package.

## Usage at arXiv.org

arXiv.org deletes bib files when submitting a pre print. As workaround, this package
supports using the file suffix `.bibtex`. When no `.bib` is found, but a `.bibtex`
file, this file is used and embedded as `.bib` file into the PDF.

## Other publishers

In general, one does not need to specify a certain publisher (or LaTeX document class).
The default setting just prints the note centered at the bottom of the first page.

```latex
\usepackage[
   key=brucker-authorarchive-2017,
   year=2017,
   publication={Anonymous et al.\ (eds).
       Proceedings of the International Conference on LaTeX-Hacks,
       CEUR-WS Vol~42,
       2017.}
   startpage={42},
   doi={10.1039/authorarchive},
   nocopyright
 ]{authorarchive}
```

Still, for some used document classes (e.g., `lncs` and `acmart`) there are specific
package options available hat produce an alternative layout.  

## Alternative Packages

The package [coverpage](https://ctan.org/pkg/coverpage) prepends a
separate PDF page before the first page of the paper.  That page
contains the bibliographic information as BibTeX entry.  One is forced
to have a `.bib` file ready and multiple institutions are not well
supported.  With `authorarchive`, the information is printed at the
bottom of the first page of the paper and required links to the
publisher are generated.

The package
[llncsconf](https://ctan.org/pkg/llncsconf) is a
light-weight alternative to this package.  It supports
[LNCS](http://www.springer.com/de/it-informatik/lncs) only.  In
comparison to `authorarchive`, it provides support for the additional
publication states "intended-to-submit" and "submitted", but no QR
code and links to the author's archive URL.
