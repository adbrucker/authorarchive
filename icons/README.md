the authorarchive LaTeX style. The use of these icons is 
restricted by the respective copyright holders. 

## ORCID iD Icon

The iD icon ([vector_iD_icon.svg](vector_iD_icon.svg)) was obtained in
SVG format from
<https://orcid.org/trademark-and-id-display-guidelines> and converted
to PDF ([vector_iD_icon.pdf](vector_iD_icon.pdf)) using
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org).  According to the use and (display
guidelines)[https://orcid.org/trademark-and-id-display-guidelines] of
the ORCID iD icons, it can be used for displaying ORCID identifiers.

An alternative to including the iD icon as PDF image is the
[academicons](https://ctan.org/pkg/academicons) package. At the time
of writing, this package requires xe(la)tex or lua(la)tex while the
[authorarchive](https://ctan.org/pkg/authorarchive) packages requires
pdf(la)tex.
